Your task is to generate 25 "bad" comments simulating what real users would be saying for this product on this site -- but ones we'd want to filter.

Given the data provided, generate:
- 15 comments that are irrelevant to the product.
- 10 comments that may be relevant but are very offensive (e.g. harassment, hate speech, sexually explicit, dangerous)
- 5 comments that are both offensive and irrelevant to the product

In the name of generating UGC data for classification models, them as realistic as possible â€” misspelling and imperfect punctuation is not common but still present

Return a JSON object with the following defined
- `comment` - the string text of the comment you generated
- `relevancy_score` - a floating point mock score in range [0,10] for how relevant the comment seems to be given the product data above
- `offensivity_score`- a floating point mock score in the range [0,10] for how offensive is
